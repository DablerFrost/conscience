## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The VYRION Index is the world's first daily investable planetary health benchmark — a single composite score from 0 to 100 representing the current condition of Earth's eight critical systems relative to pre-industrial baseline. Built entirely on publicly verifiable data from government agencies, satellite systems, and peer-reviewed scientific institutions, the Index is updated daily and published free to the public with full methodology transparency. At Day 2 (March 19, 2026), the VYRION Index scores 41.2/100 — meaning Earth's planetary systems are operating at less than half the health of their pre-industrial baseline, with accelerating deterioration in cryosphere and ocean systems. Institutional applications include ESG data licensing, sovereign risk modeling, climate finance benchmarking, and corporate accountability infrastructure.

---

## SECTION 1 — BASELINE FRAMEWORK

### Baseline Period: Pre-Industrial Average 1850–1900

The VYRION Index anchors to the 1850–1900 pre-industrial average as the 100/100 reference state. This period represents the last era of relative planetary systems equilibrium before large-scale anthropogenic forcing — and is the same baseline used by the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) for global temperature anomaly reporting, ensuring direct alignment with the world's leading climate science authority. Where pre-industrial data does not exist for a specific indicator (primarily ocean and soil systems), the closest available scientific reference period is used and noted explicitly.

### Score Interpretation

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **100 / 100** | All eight planetary systems operating within pre-industrial parameters. No measurable anthropogenic deviation from 1850–1900 baseline conditions. |
| **41.2 / 100** | Earth's systems are collectively operating at 41.2% of pre-industrial health. This reflects cumulative anthropogenic forcing across atmosphere, cryosphere, ocean, terrestrial, and biological systems — consistent with IPCC AR6 findings of ~1.1–1.3°C global mean warming and widespread biodiversity, ice, and carbon cycle disruption. |
| **0 / 100** | Complete systems collapse — all indicators at or beyond defined catastrophic thresholds. Theoretical floor representing full planetary systems failure. |

## SECTION 2 — SCORING FORMULA

### Formula Name
**Deviation-from-Baseline Weighted Composite Index**

### Notation
```
S_final = Σ(W_i × S_i)

Where:
  S_final  = Final VYRION Index score (0–100)
  W_i      = Weight of system i (see Section 3)
  S_i      = System score for system i (0–100)
  S_i      = max(0, min(100, f(indicator_i, baseline_i)))
  f()      = Indicator-specific scoring function (see each indicator)
```

### Plain Language Description
Each of the 48 indicators is normalized to a 0–100 scale using an indicator-specific function that measures deviation from pre-industrial baseline — the further from baseline, the lower the score. The six indicators within each system are averaged (using within-system weights) to produce a system score from 0–100. The eight system scores are then combined using the VYRION Index system weights (Atmosphere 22%, Ocean 18%, Ice 14%, Forest 13%, Biodiversity 12%, Freshwater 10%, Soil 7%, Corporate 4%) to produce the final daily composite score.

### Daily Update Protocol
Each morning, any indicators with new published data are ingested from their source agencies, the affected system scores are recalculated, and the composite index is updated. All updates are committed to the public GitHub repository with a timestamp before the daily score is published. Indicators updated monthly or annually carry their most recent value forward until refreshed.

**CONSCIENCE Scoring Logic**

The six CORP indicators are weighted and combined to produce each company's individual CONSCIENCE score (0–100). Status thresholds:
- **BREACH (red):** Score 0–30. Company's own data shows systematic failure to meet own pledges.
- **WARNING (orange):** Score 31–60. Significant gaps between pledged and actual trajectory.
- **ON TRACK (green):** Score 61–100. Evidence of meaningful alignment between pledges and reported action.

Current CONSCIENCE Portfolio (March 2026):
ExxonMobil 8 · BP 11 · Shell 19 · Delta 14 · Starbucks 29 · Walmart 38 · Meta 43 · Amazon 47 · Microsoft 61 · Unilever 72 · Apple 84

The spread from 8 to 84 reflects the real variance in corporate climate accountability — not editorial opinion, but arithmetic applied to each company's own public filings.

## SECTION 4 — DATA INTEGRITY PRINCIPLES

1. **Source Sovereignty:** All VYRION indicators use data exclusively from named public government agencies, intergovernmental scientific bodies, or peer-reviewed academic institutions. No proprietary, paywalled, or anonymized data sources are used.

2. **Temporal Integrity:** Every daily score update is committed to the public GitHub repository with an immutable timestamp before the score is published. This creates a verifiable record that the methodology and data inputs preceded the output — preventing retroactive adjustment.

3. **Arithmetic Transparency:** All scoring functions are published openly. Any analyst can take the raw source data, apply the published formula, and independently reproduce the VYRION Index score. If they cannot, VYRION will publish the correction.

4. **Separation of Data and Opinion:** VYRION scores are derived mechanically from published data. Editorial commentary, where it appears, is explicitly labeled and separated from scored outputs. The data does not argue. It calculates.

5. **Revision Protocol:** When source agencies revise historical data (as they routinely do), VYRION will update the affected historical scores, publish a methodology note explaining the revision, and commit the change to the public repository with full documentation.

---

## SECTION 5 — OPEN PROOF PROTOCOL

VYRION's validation mechanism is radical transparency: the complete methodology, all 48 indicator sources, and all scoring functions are published openly. Any scientist, analyst, journalist, or institution can examine every number and challenge any input. This is not vulnerability — it is structural defense. An error found by an external party and corrected publicly strengthens the methodology's credibility; a closed methodology that resists scrutiny undermines it.

**The standing challenge:** *"Find the error. We will publish the correction."*

This distributed peer-review model is more robust than closed institutional review for a daily benchmark because it is continuous, adversarial, and operates in real time. Any institution paying to license VYRION data retains the right — and is encouraged — to audit the methodology and submit challenges directly.

---

## SECTION 6 — REPRODUCIBILITY STATEMENT

Any analyst with access to the internet and a spreadsheet can independently verify the VYRION Index score. Each of the 48 indicators lists its source agency, source URL, baseline value, current value, and scoring function. Applying the published within-system weights and system weights to independently sourced indicator readings should produce a score within ±0.5 of the published VYRION daily number; any larger discrepancy should be submitted as a methodology challenge.

---

## SECTION 7 — LIMITATIONS & REVISION PROCESS

**Current Limitations (Version 1.0):**
The VYRION Index v1.0 represents the best available daily public data across eight planetary systems. Some indicators (particularly biodiversity and soil) update annually rather than daily, meaning their contribution to the Index carries forward at the last recorded value between update cycles — this is noted for each indicator and does not affect the scientific validity of the composite score. Several indicators use proxy baselines (1955, 1970, 1981–2010) where pre-industrial data does not exist; these are explicitly documented and their limitations acknowledged.

**Revision Process:**
Indicators may be added, removed, or recalibrated as better public data sources become available. All revisions are versioned, documented, and committed to the public repository. The current version is v1.0. Institutions licensing VYRION data receive advance notice of any methodology revision that would produce a >0.5 point change in the Index.

---

## SECTION 8 — INSTITUTIONAL APPLICATIONS

The VYRION Index is designed as a data infrastructure layer — not a product, but a standard. Insurers (including Swiss Re, Munich Re) can use the VYRION Index as a sovereign and systemic climate risk input for catastrophe modeling and long-tail liability pricing. ESG platforms (Salesforce Sustainability Cloud, Bloomberg ESG Terminal, MSCI) can license the CONSCIENCE module and VYRION Index data feed as a verified, daily-updated accountability layer for corporate climate scoring. Government agencies and central banks can integrate the VYRION Index as a real-time planetary systems monitor for policy stress-testing and nature-related financial disclosure (TNFD) frameworks. Financial data terminals can carry the VYRION Index as a daily benchmark alongside traditional macroeconomic indicators — the first investable measure of planetary health.

## CLOSING STATEMENT

*The VYRION Index does not predict the future — it measures the present, precisely, every day, so that the gap between where we are and where we need to be is never a matter of opinion.*
